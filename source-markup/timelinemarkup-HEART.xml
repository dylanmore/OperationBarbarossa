        <p>Timeline of the German Invasion of the Soviet Union - Up to the Defeat at Stalingrad</p>

        <p>Operation Barbarossa: Was the German codename for the invasion of the USSR which took
            place on 22 June 1941. Launched by Hitler in violation of the existing non-aggression
            treaty with Stalin, it was designed to provide the Reich with 'living space in the
            East'.</p>

        <p>The German dictator had advocated the conquest of the USSR as early as 1924 in his book,
            Mein Kampf. At the same time, the campaign was to lay the foundations for the expected
            conflict with the two Anglo-Saxon powers for primacy as a world power and to free
            Germany of the economic warfare the Allies were waging against it.</p>

        <p>The German invasion marked the beginning of a rapacious war of annihilation and conquest
            in which a scorched earth policy was employed by both sides. Hitler intended a 'ruthless
            Germanization' of the occupied eastern territories, conducted with great severity.</p>

        <p>Orders violating international law, such as the Kommissarbefehl, the order to execute all
            Red Army political commissars, and the 'Barbarossa jurisdiction Decree', which exempted
            German soldiers from prosecution if they committed a crime against any Soviet civilian,
            meant a departure from traditional military conduct for the Wehrmacht. At the same time,
            Einsatzgruppen were to carry out the murder of Jewish and Slav elements of the
            population.</p>
