        <p>Timeline of the German Invasion of the Soviet Union - Up to the Defeat at Stalingrad</p>

        <p>Operation Barbarossa: Was the German codename for the invasion of the USSR which took
            place on 22 June 1941. Launched by Hitler in violation of the existing non-aggression
            treaty with Stalin, it was designed to provide the Reich with 'living space in the
            East'.</p>

        <p>The German dictator had advocated the conquest of the USSR as early as 1924 in his book,
            Mein Kampf. At the same time, the campaign was to lay the foundations for the expected
            conflict with the two Anglo-Saxon powers for primacy as a world power and to free
            Germany of the economic warfare the Allies were waging against it.</p>

        <p>The German invasion marked the beginning of a rapacious war of annihilation and conquest
            in which a scorched earth policy was employed by both sides. Hitler intended a 'ruthless
            Germanization' of the occupied eastern territories, conducted with great severity.</p>

        <p>Orders violating international law, such as the Kommissarbefehl, the order to execute all
            Red Army political commissars, and the 'Barbarossa jurisdiction Decree', which exempted
            German soldiers from prosecution if they committed a crime against any Soviet civilian,
            meant a departure from traditional military conduct for the Wehrmacht. At the same time,
            Einsatzgruppen were to carry out the murder of Jewish and Slav elements of the
            population.</p>

        27 days at a cost of thousands of lives, begins operation. But as a lifeline it is almost
        useless, the greatest distance any lorry manages to cover in a single day is 20 miles.
            <date>December 9 1941</date> Soviet forces led by General Meretskov recapture Tikhvin.
        The railway resumes operation, bringing desperately needed supplies to Leningrad.

            <date>November 15 1941</date> After initial success, the second phase of the Moscow
        offensive is paralysed by 20 degree of frost and ever –strengthening Soviet forces.
            <date>November 27 1941</date> Panzer spearheads struggle to within 19 miles of the
        northern outskirts of Moscow, but are halted by fierce counter-attacks. South of Moscow, the

        resistance stiffens. <date>January - February 1942</date> The Soviet offensive continues to
        win small victories in the Centre and North but fails in the South. By March 1942 all Soviet

        Red Army prepares a plan (Plan Uranus) for the relief of Stalingrad, a large scale operation

        hours, some 3,500 Soviet guns and mortars open fire on the breakthrough sectors. The Soviet

        encircled German forces. But although the Red Army forces halve the territory held by
        Paulus, their numbers are insufficient to destroy his army. <date>December 12 1942</date>
        General Manstein launches Operation Winter Storm, a counter-strike with 13 divisions to
        relieve the trapped VI Army. Fighting rages for 11 days but the operation fails. Hoth’s
        “storm group” is halted 25 miles from the beleagured Germans at Stalingrad. Meanwhile,
        Soviet South –West Front handed the Germans a crushing blow, on the middle Don, North-West
        of Stalingrad. <date>December 24 1942</date> Soviet forces now attack Hoth’s relief group.
        The Germans withdraw, and by December 31 it is clear that the Red Army has fresh
